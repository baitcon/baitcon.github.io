title: Covid Policy
---
The following items are mandatory for admittance to Baitcon
* You’ve had at least 2 doses of covid vaccine, it’s been at least 2
weeks since your 2nd dose, and you’ve had at least one dose of the
2023-24 vaccine (if you have a medical exception issue, don’t hesitate
to get in touch with us)
* Test at home within 24 hours of arrival
* Test Negative a second time upon arrival: Rapid Antigen Self Test
will be provided in a Test location to be determined
* Masks Mandatory until you complete your negative test and are
cleared to proceed up the mountain and/or set up
* Notify med staff and test if you start to feel ill during the weekend
Masking isn’t required after arrival, but we recognize that some
people might feel more comfortable with extra protection. Indoor areas
— the “living room”, bathrooms, and kitchen — are likely to be spots
where some people may want to mask.
Except: people who have a known exposure (but who are asymptomatic and
testing negative) must wear a mask in shared enclosed spaces.
Refunds will be provided for anyone who tests positive before/at the event.
If you or a family/household member isn’t able to be vaccinated,
please contact med-{year}@baitcon.org
If you have a family member for whom testing is unusually difficult,
please contact med-{year}@baitcon.org
