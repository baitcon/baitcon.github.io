Will you have fun at Baitcon? We certainly hope so ‚Ä¶ Baitcon is closer to a family-reunion than Burning Man and it is truly what you ‚Äì and all the other attendees ‚Äì make it.

Some nice things to do at Baitcon: Make ice cream or just eat it, take a walk in the woods, make music, play drums, juggle or spin, stargaze, dance, laugh, hike, blow bubbles, draw, take pictures, dance, hang out having great conversations, read a book, take a nap, dance,, hug someone, walk the labyrinth.  If you‚Äôve got an idea for something fun to do, email us before Baitcon and we‚Äôll try to help you make it happen!

Some things are planned in advance, many others just come together on the spur of the moment. Most things at Baitcon are spontaneous. Here are some of the things that are happening this year:

### CAMPFIRE

There will be a campfire in the main gathering area each night.  We won‚Äôt be supplying smores ingredients but You are absolutely welcome to bring your own supplies for smores and even to share them around üôÇ

### CONTRA DANCE

We expect there will once again be a contra dance in the Great Pavilion tent with (we hope) great live music on Saturday night after the Running of the Flavors. The caller and the concert master is yet TBD.

As we‚Äôre unclear what the dance surface is like, maybe this‚Äôll be an English dance instead??

###GAMES & TOYS ‚Äì any time!

Feel free to bring games! There will be table space available for playing (though probably not during meal or ice cream serving times). Bring lawn toys with you! We‚Äôll also have a some bubble wands and bubble juice and a small variety of toys and games.

### ICE CREAM!!

Make or freeze a flavor most any time until Sunday at 4:00 p.m.!

Feastings both Saturday & Sunday

Did we mention that you should make some ice cream? Or at least plan to taste some. The Running of the Flavors will happen twice again this year. All flavors frozen before 3:30 p.m. on Saturday will be served on Saturday night. All flavors frozen after 3:30 p.m. on Saturday will be served on Sunday night. Join the Great Muppet-y Tasting Frenzy, discussion & evaluation & voting on flavors both nights!

Please see the Ice Cream page for more details.

### LABYRINTH ‚Äì any time!

Down past the cabin buildings, there is a rock labyrinth around a large tree. Enjoy but do not move or alter the stones, please.

### MASSAGE/BODYWORK/YOGA

There may be bodyworkers and massage therapists attending Baitcon.  Their time and skills may be shared or not according to their whim.

### Plus

I gather that Kimberly‚Äôs annual ‚Äúgetting‚Äù of JB will also be returning
