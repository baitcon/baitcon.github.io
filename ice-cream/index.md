title: Ice Cream

One of the main activities and joys of Baitcon (and the original purpose, even) is making ICE CREAM!

We started with just a few flavors hand-cranked and here we are 25 years later with two 200L dewers of liquid nitrogen and a ridiculous amount of cream!  You can view a (mostly) complete list of past flavors.

Above all, **making ice cream is fun!** We promise that no matter how disorganized things may seem, ice cream will get mixed, frozen, served, and eaten. If any of these steps is stressing you out, remember the new motto of the Baitcon Ice Cream Crew: **Chill**.
